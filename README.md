# Arduino Servo Control with Recording and Playback

This Arduino project allows you to control multiple servos using potentiometers, record servo movements for playback, and implement stall and burnout protection for the servos using software-based PID control.

## Functionality

### Potentiometer Control
- The project uses 5 potentiometers to manually control the positions of 5 servos.
- Adjusting the potentiometers changes the angle of the corresponding servo.

### Recording and Playback
- Pressing the record button starts recording servo movements.
- Pressing the play button starts playing back the recorded movements.
- Pressing the pause/end button pauses or stops recording/playback.

### Stall and Burnout Protection
- The project implements software-based PID control to prevent servo stalling or burning out.
- It continuously monitors servo positions and adjusts power to prevent damage.

## Wiring Instructions
